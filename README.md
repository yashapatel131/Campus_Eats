Campus Eats

	Campus eats is a database bases on a food delivery service for students living on campus. This database holds the information from everything from the orders to the drivers and everything in between. In this project we were to expand the data base to include rating tables for overall rating, driver rating, and restaurant rating. As well as create a functions, stored procedures , views, and triggers to help further our evaluation and gain insight into the services provided by campus eats.
